    Adding our high level configuration.properties file on Project level

    New -> File
    Name: configuration.properties

THIS IS NOT A COMMON PRACTICE, but if you wanna keep your notes within your project,
you can simply create files in resourses and do as you wish

this is how we did:
        right click on resources
        New -> directory
        name : project_notes

        Then: every time you want a new file in this project_notes
        right click on project_notes
        New -> File
        name: uptoyou.whatever(store it as .txt if prompted)
